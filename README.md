# Project Overview and Purpose
This is a project from Google Advanced Data Analytics.

We aim to conduct a data analytics project for the Waze app. Waze is a free navigation app similar to google maps that helps drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. The final goal is to develope a classification model to predict churn. 
Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Wazeâ€™s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as:

Who are the users most likely to churn?
Why do users churn?
When do users churn?


First, we need to conduct data preparation and get insight from the available dataset. Data visualization and Hypothesis testing may provide us with useful information. Then, several models including linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost are built to predict churn.
